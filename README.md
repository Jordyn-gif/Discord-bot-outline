# Discord Bot Outline
In this github, you will find a set of bare minimum for creating a Discord bot. The following will be included:
- Logging into the Discord API using a Discord bot
- Registering custom modules that can be used throughout your project
- Registering events, that your bot will use
- Registering commands that members can use.

### Prerequisite
Before using this outline, the following are required:
- A basic knowledge of Javascript, and [**Discord.js**](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/stable/general/welcome)
- How to use Mongoose / Mongodb (if you choose to use them as a resource)
- Some sort of host - which can be a local host, or a web server host (such as [replit](https://www.replit.com).

**Note**: If you do choose to host with replit, which is not encouraged as it isn't a very good host, a method of keeping your bot up and running is required.

### Other Stuff
If you wish to make changes, you may do so. It is discouraged to delete or modify our modules, as it can break some features.
